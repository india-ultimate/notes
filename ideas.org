* Motivation

We're here to play Ultimate! Why should we care about a digital archive?

Let's see if these questions interest you?

** Data archive
- How many of you are playing your first NCUC? Having fun?
- Do you know how well or badly your college performed in the last edition?
  - What was the team? Scores? Stats?
- When was the first NCUC? Who participated?

** Photo archive
- Who is your favorite Ultimate player?
- Have you seen any pictures of them in your first tournament?
- Wouldn't that be nice to have?

** Video archive
- Has any of you watched any games live?
- How many of these have been on Instagram live? Can you search back any of those?
- Wouldn't it be nice to have an easier way to find them?!

* What?
- Build an archive --- Most of the content we consume today has been created in
  the last 3 days!
- Make it easily to search scores/stats/data
- Start with parsing existing score and spirit sheets

- Link it with photos, videos, etc.
- May be even make a better system to collect scores/spirit scores.
- Potentially useful for research on the sport, auctions data, etc.
